We welcome contact from prospective students and postdocs who are looking to do gound-breaking research at the interface of biology, physics, and chemistry. We are committed to supporting and promoting equality, diversity, and inclusion. We especially encourage applications from underrepresented groups in science.

## Applying to do an undergraduate research project

We welcome undergraduates to carry out their final year projects in our lab. You will be notified of lab projects offered each year via the relevant [MPhys (PX402) or BSc (PX3A0) modules](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/current/teach/modules/). You are encouraged to contact Ying to discuss the listed project in more detail prior to submitting your project choices.

We support summer research project applications through the [Undergraduate Research Support Scheme (URSS)](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/skills/urss/) if you are doing a science-based undergraduate course at Warwick, and we are open to applications across the [whole faculty](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/). URSS will give you the chance to lead your own project hosted in our lab for 6-10 weeks, as well as carry out a public engagement project. Deadlines are usually in February. Please contact Ying by mid-January to discuss if interested.

There is some [additional information on Vacation Projects from the department that is relevant to undergraduates in Physics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/current/teach/general/vac/).

## Applying for a PhD position
- Please ensure you meet the [departmental entry requirements](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/admissions/postgraduate/phdormsc/).
- Please check the information on [fees and funding](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/admissions/postgraduate/phd/eligibility).
    - Funding is available specifically for [students who are from under-represented groups in physics (IoP)](https://www.iop.org/about/support-grants/bell-burnell-fund).
    - While funding is often restricted to students who have "home" status, EU and international students with an outstanding track record can apply to the [Chancellor's International Scholarship](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/dc/schols_fund/scholarships_and_funding/chancellors_int).

### PhD Course Entry requirements
In the UK, the performance of a student through their undergraduate course is provided as a *classification* of their degree. The usual [classifications](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/aro/dar/quality/categories/examinations/conventions/ug13/) are:
1. First class honours
2. Second class upper division (2.1) honours
3. Second class lower division (2.2) honours
4. Third class honours
5. Pass, also sometimes called an ordinary degree (without honours)

In general, we require a Master degree with first class or upper second class honours.

What does this mean if you did not do a UK degree?
Check the [international qualifications pages](https://warwick.ac.uk/study/international/admissions/entry-requirements).


## Applying for a postdoc
- We are looking for candidates with experience in either:
    - cell biology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and related fields; or
    - NMR, especially solid-state NMR
- We will support fellowship applications for
    - UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)
    - Royal Society [Newton International Fellowships](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/newton-international/)
    - European Commission [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships)
    - Wellcome Trust [Early Career Awards](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/early-career-awards)
    - [Leverhulme Trust](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships)
- We are also open to applications from candidates who identify a [suitable funding opportunity](https://ecrcentral.org/fundings) from other sources.
- Please ensure contact is made with sufficient advanced notice for fellowships, ideally no less than a few months before the closing date.
- From time to time, funded positions will be available for specific topics.
