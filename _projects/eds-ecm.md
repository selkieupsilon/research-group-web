 In collaboration with Darius Koester and Sabeeha Malek of the Centre for Mechanochemical Cell Biology, we carried out cell culture of human fibroblast cell lines for Ehler-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Using ssNMR, we can understand molecular-level changes in the ECM that may underlie key symptoms of this genetic disease.
