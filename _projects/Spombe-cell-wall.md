 In collaboration with Mohan Balasubramanian of the Warwick Medical School, we investigate the cell wall of fission yeast, _Schizosaccharomyces pombe_. Fission yeast is a key model organism in fungal and cell cycle research. SsNMR provide a means to quantify changes in cell wall composition upon novel and specific genetic manipulations.
